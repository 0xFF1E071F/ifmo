Use your own ideas. Here are some examples.

Yes, there is. There's Emily's Cafe on the corner of Center Avenue and First Street.
or
No, there isn't. I prefer the coffee shops in the mall.
Is there a big department store?
Yes, there is. There's one on Main Street, across from the bank.

No, there isn't. The big department stores aren’t in the city center.
Are there any unusual stores?
Yes, there are. There are lots of unusual jewelry and clothes stores on Elm Street.
or
No, there aren't any. You need to go to across town to find unusual stores.
Is there a convenience store?
Yes, there's one on Third Avenue, between the restaurant and the post office.
or
No, there aren't any. But there's a big supermarket.
Are there any cheap restaurants?
